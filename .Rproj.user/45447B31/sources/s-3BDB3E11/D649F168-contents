\usage{
calculateRFM(
  data,
  weight_recency = 1,
  weight_frequency = 1,
  weight_monetary = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data set}

\item{weight_recency}{a number specifying the weight of the recency}

\item{weight_frequency}{a number specifying the weight of the frequency}

\item{weight_monetary}{a number specifying the weight of the monetary}
}
\value{
a table with the following columns:
        \code{Customer} the identification of the customer
        \code{recency} the recency score for that customer
        \code{frequency} the frequency score for that customer
        \code{monetary} the monetary score for that customer
        \code{finalscore} the final score with weights applied for that customer
        \code{group} the group the user belongs to
}
\description{
Calculates the RFM score for a given dataset
}
\details{
\code{data} contains the transaction data. The data set must contain
            a column labelled 'Customer' that allows unique customer
            identification, a column labelled "TransDate", indicating
            the purchase date and a column labelled "PurchAmount"
            specifying the total spending per purchase.
